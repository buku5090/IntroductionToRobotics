## Homework 3
### Hardware Components:
 - 1 7-segment display
 - 1 joystick
 - resistors and wires (as needed)

### Task Requirements:
 - Use the joystick to naturally change the position of the turned on segment.
 - The 7-segment display will have 2 stages:
  - hi

### Implementation:
 - Firstly, I connected one potentiometer to a one-color LED to understand how it works. 
 - Then I connected 3 potentiometeres and tested each one of them using the Serial.Write() function so that I can see that each potentiometer works properly.
 - I removed the one-color LED and placed the RGB one and I used 1 resistor for each color of the RGB LED. 
 - I placed a non-connected one-color LED next to each of the potentiometers to indicate the color the potentiometer refers to.
 - Finally, I successfully read the input from the potentiometers and redirected it to the LED.

### Resources:
 - Mostly, I used the data provided in the laboratories.

### Notes:
 - It was a lot of fun horsing around with Arduino.
