## Homework 2
### Hardware Components:
 - 5 LEDS
 - 1 button
 - 1 buzzer
 - resistors and wires (as needed)

### Task Requirements:
 - Simulate the traffic lights for a crosswalk
 - The people that want to cross will have two lights (Red and Green)
 - The cars will have three lights (Red, Green and Yellow)

### Resources:
 - I mostly used the shared code, but I also read the official docs for specific functions.

### Notes:
 - Seeing the crosswalk functioning was a very pleasent feeling.
